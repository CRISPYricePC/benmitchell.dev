Hi, so new DLC for Outer Wilds is out, and while I really enjoyed it, I found many parts (especially *those* parts) to
be extremely frustrating to figure out / tedious to get around. For that reason, I've created a spoiler-walled guide to
beating this DLC:

## Before getting started
{:.no_toc}

There's a few things you should know before starting to use this guide and especially before revealing any spoilers.
They're so important I'll put them in bold.

1. **Do not reveal any more information than you actually need.** If you've revealed
something that has given you an idea of what to do, go out and do it before revealing the next thing; it might be all
you need to continue in your adventure
2. **Only start revealing spoilers if you're genuinely stuck**. The worst thing that could happen is something is spoilt
to you that you definitely could've figured out yourself
3. **If you're reading a chapter where the name isn't obvious which part of the game it's on about, stop reading**.
Information discovered in previous chapters will *not* be marked as spoiler, so you're on track to ruining your own
experience by skipping to the end and finding out that <span class="spoiler">REDACTED</span> was
<span class="spoiler">REDACTED</span> which led to <span class="spoiler">REDACTED</span>.

### Using spoilers
{:.no_toc}

Spoilers are fun objects. Here's a comprehensive guide to using them

Just so you can spot one in the wild, spoilers look like this: <span class="spoiler">You've been spoiled!</span>. Click
it to reveal its contents.

But that's not all, a spoiler will be prefixed with one of the following:

1. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Consider the colour of the sky</span> - A *hint* spoiler. These are usually okay to
open if you're stuck. They should lead you to an answer through probing rather than outright give you an answer.
2. **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">The sky is blue</span> - An *answer* spoiler. This will just give you the answer.
Please don't open this unless you have already opened all previous hints, and are *literally running round in circles
with no idea what to do next*. Be warned, here be dragons.

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is chaptered. If you're joining this guide half-way through your playthrough, you can reveal the
chapters by hovering your cursor (clicking will take you to the link)

* TOC
{:toc}

## 1. <span class="spoiler">The Beginning</span>

Nothing interesting has happened just yet. But I guess the first step is to **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">purchase and
download the DLC</span>

### 1a. <span class="spoiler">Where do I start</span>

A lot of people have been struggling to find the catalyst to kickstart this DLC, so here's a spoiler wall to find it.
First, the hints:

1. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">You can find something new in a starter area</span>
2. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Where did you find the launch codes?</span>
3. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Go see if there's anything new in the observatory</span>

And now for the answer: **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">Go to the observatory and check the exhibit marked "New
Exhibit" to the left of the entrance. You'll spot it because there's a model satellite hanging from the ceiling</span>

By now, you should be well on your way to starting the DLC. Hopefully, you won't need to look at this guide again for
a while. But if you're stuck on somewhere further along, keep reading.

### 1b. <span class="spoiler">The Radio Tower</span>

Assuming you read the information in the observatory, you should now be looking for a Radio Tower on Timber Hearth. It
should be fairly easy to find, but if you're stuck, **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">try looking for a large clump of
trees, the tower is next to those.</span> Once you've found the tower, there are a few things you should look out for.

1. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Look for logs or notes from other Hearthians</span>
2. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">What is on the walls of the inside of the tower?</span>
3. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">How would you scan for an unidentified signal?</span>
4. **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">There are pictures on the walls of the tower</span>, **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Can
you gather any information about each?</span>. The answer to this question is in the next chapter.

Now for a complete answer: **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">A Hearthian's log in the radio tower speaks of an anomaly
in one of the pictures. You can see this anomaly on the wall (it's the one with the black dot in front of the sun).
Gabbro was sent to investigate the satellite that took the photos for instrument or equipment failures.</span>

If it's not obvious where to go from now, all I'll say is **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">the signalscope holds the
key</span>. If you're still stuck, **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">use your signalscope to find the Radio Tower's
frequency and use that frequency to find the deep-space satellite. This is the next place you need to head to.</span>

### 1c. <span class="spoiler">The Satellite</span>

By this point, you should be on your way to investigate the anomaly. But once you reach the satellite, you might be a
bit unsure as to what to do. Here's some hints:

1. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Who was sent to investigate the anomaly originally, would it be worth asking them
questions?</span>
2. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">Recall the additional information below the pictures in the Radio Tower. Is there
anything specific to the anomalous picture?</span>
3. **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">There's a screen on the side of the satellite</span>
4. **`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">Wait until the data on the screen matches the data under the anomalous photo</span>

Okay fun, what now? A hint: **`(H)`**<span class="spoiler">What's causing that?</span>, and an answer:
**`(A)`**<span class="spoiler">Can you fly there?</span>

Aaaaand that's chapter 1 done! Pat yourself on the back, but not for too long, we have to keep going.

## 2. <span class="spoiler">The Stranger</span>
